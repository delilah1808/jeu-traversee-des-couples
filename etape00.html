   <h1>The game's rules</h1>
   <p>Welcome to the couples crossing, a game of logic and strategy that will require you to think carefully before acting!
Come solve the couples dilemma if you’re ready

Three couples must cross a river.
A boat found there can only carry two people.
If a woman can’t stay with other men without her husband’s presence, how are they going to arrange the back and forth so husbands don’t get
jealous ?

It’s up to you to solve this problem !</p>
